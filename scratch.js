//****************** FUNCTION INVOKATION **************//
guessOnce();

//****************** NOTES **************//

//feature 7 
//Letâ€™s add a feature that records the number of guesses for each unique name 
//that is entered when the game is started. If someone with the same name played 
//before, then when they get a correct answer, it tells them if they beat their previous attempt (less guesses is better). 

 
//guessOnce();

////Issues I ran into while doing this project////
// 1 - trying to compare strings (users input) to numbers (secret number)
// 2 - When inserting a callback function into another function ensuring that I actually invoke the callback inside the 
// cont - functions declaration or the callback won't run
// 3 - when I use expression or function it failed but when I store the prompt (users input) into a variable and run it, it works.
//cont it worked bc u cant just invoke the function (callback) and the just say if (callback == secretNumber). You have to compare the 
//cont secretNumber to the callback's result which HAS TO BE STORED IN A VARIABLE or you can use it in another step. If you want to use something
// eslewhere (not your current step) you have to store it in a variable to store the result (otherwise you are just running the function etc.).
// 4 - The same prinicple in #3 (storing results into a variable) is similar to this. It wouldn't work bc my first function which i was later using as
// cont - a callback for another function didn't return anything. I only had it storeing a variable for the prompt. However, if Im going to use the function
// later (what callbacks are for) IT MUST RETURN THE VALUE.
// 5 - callback is not a function
// 6 - dont need to use callbacks if u already know what u want (i orginally had created callbacks (seperate functions) for the prompt to get user input
// cont - as well as the guess again function. The intention was to make it simpler by reducing the complexity of my functions --> ionstead of creating 1 
// cont - larger function w/ 8 tasks..create 3 seperate functions with 2 tasks and just use them as callbacks. However, in the end this just made it more confusing
// cont - due to the callbacks)
// 7 - when I replay when same person (feature 7) it did't generate a new number (bc it was only done when the page refreshes and it didn't reset the count 
// cont - (number of guesses/ attempts))
// 8 - It only works for 2 rounds..to make it more i would need to some how create a loop that i++ each time i run play again.


//Takeaways/ Lessons learned//
// 1 - Store results into variable if going to use/ need them elsewhere
// 2 - Functions need to return something especially if going to be used elsewhere (callbacks etc). When we use return in a function it 
// cont - "ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller." (even though it returns a value to the function caller
// cont - you still have to store that return into a variable if you want to use it elsewhere (#1 above))
// 3 - When comparing pay attention to types
// 4 - When using callbacks dont forget to invoke the callback inside the function declaration
// 5 - When to use callbacks? only use callbacks when you need to; callbacks are useful in situations 
// cont. - wherein a value cannot be returned immediately for whatever reason (perhaps it is just a long running operation which is better 
// cont. - performed asynchronously).
// 6 - When to use parameters? Scope limitations or you dont know what the input (name (function) or value) on the function is going to be
// 7 - use console.logs() everywhere to resolve issues/ errors
